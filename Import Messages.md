**`/importmessage`**
> Sends Discord Message JSON as a message

This command allows you to send a message from a valid Message Object. Most people use this command to send *fancy* embeds used for info channels. Other people in your server can edit imported messages by using the context menu if they have the `Manage Messages` permission and have permission to talk in the message's channel. This is a great way to allow your staff team to maintain info messages.
